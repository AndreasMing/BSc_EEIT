# Analog-to-Digital & Digital-to-Analog Conversion

## Steps of A/D- and D/A-Conversion

![Signal classification in a/d- and d/a-conversion](images/paste-7.png){width="80%"}

### A/D

**Sample**: Signal values are recorded at sampling rate $f_S$. This yields a train of pulses.

**Quantize**: The discrete signal values are mapped to a given number of quantization levels.

**Code**: The quantified values can be stored in a coded way. DSPs most often store the quantified values.

### D/A

**Decode**: The coded samples are converted back into a suitable representation for the digital-to-analog conversion method used.

**Hold**: A momentary discrete signal value is constant over the sample period $T_S$.

**Interpolate**: The continuous staircase signal form is smoothed by a low-pass-filter.

## Sampling and Aliasing

Sampling a time-continuous signal $x(t)$ corresponds to a multiplication with a Dirac impulse series. The resulting signal $x_S(t)$ can be regarded as a train of weighted Dirac impulses.

$$
x_S(t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x(t)\cdot\delta(t-nT_S)
$$

Through the application of the Fourier property $x(t)e^{j2\pi f_0t}\laplace X(f-f_0)$ we obtain the frequency spectrum of the sampled signal as

$$
X_S(f)=\frac{1}{T_S}\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty X(f-kf_S)
$$

## Observation

The frequency of the analog signal $x(t)$ consists of the original spectrum $X(f)$ superimposed (*Ã¼berlagert*) by mirror images of the spectrum

$$
f_k=k\cdot\frac{f_S}{N}
$$

### Aliasing

## Sampling Theorem

An analog signal $x(t)$ with $X(f)=0$ for $|f|>|f_{max}|$ is uniquely defined by its sample values $x[n]=x(nT_S)$, if for the sampling frequency $F_S=\frac{1}{T_S}$ holds:

$$
f_s>2\cdot f_{max}
$$

### Band-Pass Sampling

$x(t)$ can be perfectly reconstructed if an integer $N\geq 0$ exists, such that $X(f)=0$ holds for all frequencies $f$ outside

$$
-\frac{N+1}{2}f_S\leq f\leq -\frac{N}{2}f_S\qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{N}{2}f_S\leq f\leq \frac{N+1}{2}f_S
$$

For a given band-pass signal with given limits $f_{min}$ and $f_{max}$ it can be checked if the sampling frequency $f_S$ can be used ($N\geq1$)

$$
\frac{2\cdot f_{min}}{N}\geq f_S\geq\frac{2\cdot f_{max}}{N+1}
$$

For sampling with $N=$ **even** we get the mirror spectrums

\newpage

For sampling with $N =$ **odd** we get the mirror spectrums

## Spectrum Correction

Note that for $N$ odd, the original spectrum appears "inverted" in the base band. The original structure of the spectrum can be re-obtained by changing the sign of every second sample of the time-domain sequence, i.e.

$$
\tilde{x}=(-1)^n\cdot x[n]
$$
:::

## Reconstruction

### Ideal Reconstruction

Sampled signals w/o Aliasing can be *theoretically* reconstructed error-free. For this all mirror-spectra must be eliminated by a ideal low-pass filter. Because of the property $\text{rect}\left(\frac{t}{T}\right)\laplace |T|\cdot \text{si}(\pi Tf)$ the ideal interpolation equals

$$
x(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x(nT_S)\cdot\text{sinc}(\pi f_S(t-nT_S))
$$

::: callout-note
## Ideal values

At the points $t=nT_S$ all values of except of $x(nT_S)$ equal $0$. Thus at every point of $x(nT_S)$ the signal reaches the right value.

**Caution!** because of the infinit sum of sinc-pulses, the values between $x(nT_S)$ aren't particularly correct. Also the further to the "edge" of $x$ you get, the more inaccurate it gets.
:::

### Practical Reconstruction

In practice Reconstruction is very often done with a simple *zero-order-holder* (ZHO). Such operation holds each sample value constant over a subsequent sample interval $T_S$. This results in a stair-case waveform, thus making a very poor low-pass filter. For this reason a analog low-pass filter is usually implemented.

Without analog filtering the **SNR** can be approximated as

$$
\text{SNR}\approx 6dB\cdot \log_2\left(\frac{f_S}{f_0}\right)-11dB
$$

## Quantization of Signals

### Uniform Quantization

When quantizing sample values with $W$ bits, the dynamic range $R$ of the sampled signal $x[n]$ can be divided into $2^W$ intervals of equal width. Thus, the width of one **quantization step** is given by

$$
\Delta=\frac{R}{2^W}
$$

| Mid-Tread                                                         | Mid-Rise                                          |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Decision levels at $\pm0.5\Delta,\pm1.5\Delta,\pm2.5\Delta,\dots$ | Decision levels at $0,\pm\Delta,\pm2\Delta,\dots$ |
| ![](images/paste-15.png){width="30%"}                             | ![](images/paste-16.png){width="30%"}             |
| $-\frac{\Delta}{2}<\epsilon\leq\frac{\Delta}{2}$                  | $-\Delta<\epsilon\leq0$                           |

Furthermore **Clipping** occurs if the signal values of $x[n]$ are outside of the full-scale range $R$.

### Quantization noise

The quantization error $\epsilon$ manifests itself as noise superimposed to the quantized signal

$$
\epsilon[n]=x_q[n]-x[n]
$$

Model of quantization noise (@fig-blockDia) and probability density function (@fig-probDenseFunc)
:::

The power of the quantization noise signal is

$$
P_\epsilon=\frac{1}{\Delta}\int_{-\frac{\Delta}{2}}^{\frac{\Delta}{2}}\epsilon^2d\epsilon = \frac{\Delta^2}{12}
$$

The signal-to-noise ratio expressed in dB yields

$$
SNR_{dB}=6\cdot W+10\cdot\log_{10}\left(\frac{12\cdot P_x}{R^2}\right)
$$

::: callout-note
## For Harmonic- & Full-Scale-Signals

$$
SNR_{dB}=6\cdot W+1.76\approx 6\cdot W
$$

For every additional Bit, the SNR can be sixfold in $[dB]$.

### Logarithmic Quantization

One way to increase the SNR associated with quantization, is to adapt the quantizer characteristics to the statistical properties of the signal being quantized. One kind of signal with these properties are voice signals were very small amplitude values are orders of magnitude more likely than large amplitude values ( @fig-probDistVoice ).

Comparison of uniform and logarithmic quantization
:::

There are several standards for implementing Logarithmic Quantization. One such standard is the $\mu$-law algorithm

$$
f_\mu(x)=\text{sgn}(x)\cdot\frac{\ln(1+\mu\cdot |x|)}{\ln(1+\mu)}\qquad-1\leq x\leq1
$$

With this applied the relative error can be significantly improved ( @fig-LogWuantError ).
